# Project Title

I created a Dad's joke generator... Â¿Will u be able to laugh or cry? Let's find out.


## API Reference

#### Get all items

```http
  GET https://icanhazdadjoke.com/
```



  
## Lessons Learned

I created this because I wanted to practise my first API with only JavaScript. Everytime you press the button NEXT, a new joke will apear from this API.

I used ASYNC AWAIT FETCH

I hope you like it!!
